Reporting information from census data

Please see http://testofti.me:5000/ for a working example.

Flask was my framework (Python) of choice, with largely jQuery for the frontend. The SQLite DB file is configurable through the census.settings config file. The application can be deployed by installing Flask and then running "python home.py".
